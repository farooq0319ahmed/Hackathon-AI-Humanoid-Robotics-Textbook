# Introduction to Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on humanoid robotics! This book is designed to take you from the fundamentals of robot operating systems to advanced AI integration, providing hands-on experience with real-world robotics platforms.

## Overview

This book is organized into four comprehensive modules that build upon each other:

1. **The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Learn the fundamentals of ROS 2 architecture, nodes, topics, services, and actions
2. **The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Explore simulation environments for testing robot behaviors safely
3. **The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)** - Implement perception, navigation, and control pipelines using AI
4. **Vision-Language-Action (VLA) & Capstone** - Integrate multi-modal interaction and complete an end-to-end project

## Target Audience

This book is designed for:
- Students learning robot control systems
- Developers implementing humanoid robots with ROS 2
- Engineers working with simulation and AI integration
- Anyone interested in the intersection of robotics and artificial intelligence

## Prerequisites

Before starting this book, you should have:
- Basic programming experience (Python preferred)
- Understanding of Linux command line
- Familiarity with basic robotics concepts (helpful but not required)

## Hardware Requirements

- **Workstation**: 8+ cores CPU, 32GB+ RAM, NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (RTX 3070 or equivalent)
- **Alternative**: NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX/NX for edge deployment
- **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (recommended)

## Getting Started

Begin with Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System to establish the foundational knowledge needed for the subsequent modules. Each module is designed to be self-contained while building upon previous concepts.
