# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Set up and configure Gazebo simulation environments for humanoid robots
- Understand physics simulation principles including gravity, collisions, and dynamics
- Integrate URDF/SDF robot descriptions into simulation environments
- Simulate various sensors including LiDAR, cameras, and IMUs
- Create high-fidelity visualizations using Unity for human-robot interaction
- Validate simulation results against real-world expectations

## Overview

Welcome to the Digital Twin module! In this module, you'll learn how to create virtual environments that accurately represent physical robots and their surroundings. A "Digital Twin" is a virtual replica of a physical system that allows you to test, validate, and optimize robot behaviors in a safe, controlled environment before implementing them on real hardware.

This module covers two major simulation platforms:
- **Gazebo**: A physics-based simulation environment with realistic physics, sensors, and rendering
- **Unity**: A high-fidelity visualization platform for human-robot interaction and advanced graphics

## Module Structure

This module is organized into several focused sections:

1. **Gazebo Simulation** - Core physics simulation, environment setup, and sensor modeling
2. **Unity Integration** - High-fidelity visualization and human-robot interaction
3. **Sensor Simulation** - LiDAR, cameras, IMUs, and other sensor types
4. **Physics Modeling** - Realistic physics parameters and collision handling
5. **Hands-On Exercises** - Practical implementation activities

Each section builds upon the previous one, providing both theoretical understanding and practical experience with simulation environments.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- Basic understanding of URDF robot modeling
- ROS 2 environment properly configured
- Gazebo and Unity installed on your system

## What's Next

After mastering simulation environments, you'll be ready to move on to Module 3, where you'll learn to implement perception, navigation, and control pipelines using NVIDIA Isaac tools.
