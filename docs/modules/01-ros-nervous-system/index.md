# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 architecture
- Create and run basic ROS 2 nodes in Python
- Implement publisher-subscriber communication patterns
- Define and use services and actions
- Create and configure launch files and parameters

## Overview

Welcome to the foundation of humanoid robotics! This module introduces you to ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), the middleware that serves as the "nervous system" for your robot. Just as the nervous system enables communication between different parts of the human body, ROS 2 enables communication between different software components that control your robot's hardware.

In this module, you'll learn the core concepts that underpin all robot software development: nodes, topics, services, and actions. These concepts form the backbone of how robots process information, make decisions, and interact with their environment.

## Module Structure

This module is organized into several focused sections:

1. **Architecture** - Understanding the core concepts of ROS 2
2. **Nodes, Topics, Services** - The fundamental communication patterns
3. **URDF Modeling** - Defining robot components and structure
4. **Hands-On Exercises** - Practical implementation activities

Each section builds upon the previous one, providing both theoretical understanding and practical experience.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of Linux command line
- Completed the setup process outlined in the Getting Started guide

## What's Next

After mastering these fundamentals, you'll be ready to move on to Module 2, where you'll learn to create simulation environments to safely test your robot behaviors before implementing them on real hardware.
